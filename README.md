# Node.js Blogging System with DevOps Pipeline
This project implements a robust DevOps pipeline for a sample Node.js-based backend system. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process, ensuring continuous delivery and a secure infrastructure.

# Project Overview
The project includes the following features:
Backend System: A Node.js blogging system API with functionalities like user authentication, basic models, and CRUD operations.
Version Control: Git repository to track code changes and enable collaboration.
Build Automation: Build scripts using npm to manage dependencies and create a production-ready build.
Continuous Integration (CI): CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate tasks such as linting, testing, and security scanning.
Continuous Delivery (CD): CD pipeline to deploy the application to a cloud platform (DigitalOcean) upon successful completion of the CI pipeline.
Monitoring and Logging: Integration with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and Winston for logging.
Security: Implementation of secure coding practices, secrets management with HashiCorp Vault, and access control mechanisms.
